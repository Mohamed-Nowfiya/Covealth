<h4><b>VACCINE</b></h4><br>
<img src="vac.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br>
<p>Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body natural defences, the immune system to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. 
After vaccination, if the body is later exposed to those disease-causing germs, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.</p>
<br><br>We now have vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, helping people of all ages live longer, healthier lives. 
Immunization currently prevents 2-3 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles.<br><br>

<h4><b>COVID 19</b></h4><br>

<br>
<p>On one hand, doctors, medical staffs and other social workers are trying to control the affect of covid 19 by treatment and vaccination to the people all ver the world but on the other hand, the mortality rate due to covid 19 rises rapidly in an unimaginable rate which put every life in a risk.
Government of India have been implementing many rules and regulations for the sake of people's life and to control the pandemic situation. We are entering 3rd wave of covid 19 which is really dangerous than the previous one.
So we have to protect ourselves by staying in our home for our family and friends, so that we could bring end to all the problems that we've been dealing with past 1 and half year.
<br>India has so far given more than 100 million doses of two approved vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin.<br><ul>
